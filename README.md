## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

![](Images/SummaryStats_Del%231.png)

  - The following variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset: (a) ground_clearance, (b) vehicle_length, and (c) the intercept (which indicates there are other variables and factors that contribute to the variation in mpg that have not been included in our model.
  - The slope of the linear model is not zero. According to our model, multiple variables (ground_clearance, vehicle_length, intercept) were statistically unlikely to provide random amounts of variance to the model. 
  - This linear model predicts mpg of MechaCar prototypes fairly effectively. In this case, r-squared = .71, indicating that roughly 71% of mpg predictions will be correct when using this model.
